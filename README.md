# Biophysics introduction

This repository includes the course material related to the bioBUDS program at Stanford University.
The purpose of this course is to familiarize biology undergraduates with statistical physics and specifically diffusion statistics.

Goals of the course:
1. Theoretical understanding of diffusion statistics.
2. Tracer particle simulations.
3. Understanding the effects of trajectory length on the vatiability of diffusion statistics.
4. Understanding the effects of geometric confinement on diffusion.

Requirements:
1. The studetns should be familiar with object oriented programing.
2. This is a hands-on course, so we expect active engagement.
