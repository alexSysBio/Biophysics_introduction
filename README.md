# Introduction in biophysics - statistically significant complexities in cytoplasmic diffusion

This repository includes the teaching material in Biophysics.
This course is intended for biology undergraduates, and provides and introduction to basic concepts of cytoplasmic diffusion and statistical physics.
The purpose of this course is to familiarize biology undergraduates with statistical physics and specifically diffusion statistics.

Goals of the course:
1. Theoretical understanding of diffusion statistics.
2. Tracer particle simulations.
3. Understanding the effects of trajectory length on the variability of diffusion statistics.
4. Understanding the effects of geometric confinement on diffusion.

Requirements:
1. The studetns should be familiar with object oriented programming.
2. This is a hands-on course, so we expect active engagement and experimentation. Be creative and dare to perform analyses and generate plots beyond the [guided tutorial](https://github.com/alexSysBio/Biophysics_introduction/blob/main/Biophysics_introduction.ipynb).
